# Tic-Tac-Toe: The AI That Roasts You As It Beats You

## ðŸ’¡ What is this?

This is a classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game implemented in C...  
...with a twist: the AI has a superiority complex, a sense of sarcasm, and zero chill.

The AI will:
- Evaluate moves using heuristic grading.
- Try to win, block, and corner you like a pro.
- Mock your mistakes.
- Cry (dramatically) when it loses.
- Take your FEEEEET when it wins. ðŸ¦¶

All packed inside a single beautiful .c file. Yes, itâ€™s monolithic. Deal with it.

## ðŸš€ How to Run

2. Compile using:
3. Run the game:

4. Follow the prompts, press enter for dramatic flair, and try not to lose.

## ðŸ§  How the AI Works

- Uses a 3x3 board to simulate the game.
- Grades every possible move based on:
- Blocking the player (+90)
- Corners and center bonuses
- Potential win forks (can be added)
- AI plays `'o'`, player plays `'x'`
- First or second turn choice available
- Sarcasm not optional

## ðŸŽ® Controls

- You will be asked to enter coordinates for your move in the form:

where x = row (0 to 2), y = column (0 to 2)

- Want to mess with the AI? Try entering `9 9`. Youâ€™ll see. ðŸ˜‰

## ðŸ¤– Future Ideas

- Implement true Minimax or Alpha-Beta pruning
- Add a GUI using SDL or ncurses
- Let the AI trash talk in more languages
- Port to web as a rage-inducing browser game

## ðŸ“Ž File Contents

- `tic_tac_toe.c` â€“ All the logic, AI, print statements, and sass
- No external libraries. Just ANSI C and a bad attitude.
